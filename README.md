# Multi-Layer Perceptron for Fashion MNIST Classification

## Description
This project involves the implementation and training of a feed-forward neural network (also known as a "multi-layer perceptron" or "MLP") on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 greyscale images of fashion items divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

The main objective of this project is to train a classifier to identify the type of fashion item given an image. We train and tune the model on the training images and then evaluate its performance on the test images that the model did not see during training. This task is an example of a supervised learning problem, where we are given both input and labels (targets) to learn from. This is in contrast to unsupervised learning where we only have inputs from which to learn patterns or reinforcement learning where an agent learns how to maximize a reward signal through interaction with its environment.

## Data
The Fashion MNIST dataset used in this project consists of 70,000 greyscale images and their labels. The dataset is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The aim is to train a classifier to identify the class value (what type of fashion item it is) given the image.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/wass009/fashion-mnist-mlp.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd fashion-mnist-mlp`

## Usage
1. Run the application: `python main.py`
2. Follow the prompts in the application to train the MLP and classify the fashion items.

## Features
- Implementation of a feed-forward neural network
- Training the MLP on the Fashion MNIST dataset
- Classifying fashion items based on their greyscale images
